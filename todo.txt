- fix spiral problem w. pcd gradient descent
  - last atom never moves; clearly an error
    - with pcd_mode on or off

- test dImoldx() function by putting in values where you know the answer...
  - (done) write the unit test
  - ... I can't think of an example where I know the answer!


- isn't it true that using PCD gives an error via a theoretical reference structure which may not match experiment (we are assuming it does)? Absolute I(q) would not have this problem...
