- run ~100 minima searches, compare them all...
  - do it again for another jump forward e.g. to target_30 or 40 (starting from 20)


- add find_initial_conditions step in run_sa.py
  > 100 loop of N=200, ds=0.1, t=0.2, A=0.1, H-modes off


- strategy:
  > "find initial conditions" function
  > 200 steps of larger step-size e.g. 0.1 seems to work
    >> "fix hydrogens" somehow... because they go crazy
       >>> during this phase don't move them at all ??? Or move them the same amount as their carbon?
           --- i.e. set the displacements to 0 for hydrogens
       >>> OR at the end calculate the carbon displacement, and reset the H to starting_H + that displacement    
    >> select the ~10 of those with lowest f_targ as starting points

- automate distances for save_array.xyz -> r01.dat, r02.dat, ..., r56.dat 
- plot them for different T0, N, step_size etc.

- fix spiral problem w. pcd gradient descent
  - last atom never moves; clearly an error
    - with pcd_mode on or off

- test dImoldx() function by putting in values where you know the answer...
  - (done) write the unit test
  - ... I can't think of an example where I know the answer!


=== random notes ===

- isn't it true that using PCD gives an error via a theoretical reference structure which may not match experiment (we are assuming it does)? Absolute I(q) would not have this problem...
